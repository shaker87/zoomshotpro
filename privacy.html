                        <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
                        <p>Caloppa is the State law in the US, which obligates commercial websites and online services
                            to publicly disclose data protection guidelines. This law extends beyond California and
                            requires that a website owner in the United States (potentially also worldwide) whose
                            website raises personal data from Californian consumers, needs to publish a visible privacy
                            statement on his website on which it is clearly described which data is collected and who
                            has access to it. To find out more about this, visit:

                        <p>Users can visit our website anonymously.</p>
                        <p>As soon as these data privacy guidelines are drawn up, we will publish them on our starting

                        <p>The link to our data protection guidelines comprises the term “Data protection" and can be
                            easily found on the webpage indicated at the top.</p>
                        <p>Users will be informed of any amendments to our data protection guidelines:</p>

                            <li>Via email</li>

                        <h5>How does our website deal with Do-Not-Track-Signals?</h5>
                        <p>We respect Do-Not-Track-Signals and do not follow, place or advertise when a Do-Not-Track
                            (DNT) browser mechanism is available.</p>
                        <h5>Does our website allow third party suppliers to pursue behavioural issues?</h5>
                        <p>We also want to inform you that we do not allow third party suppliers to pursue behavioural
                            issues.</p>
                        <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
                        <p>The provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) give parents control
                            over the collection of personal data of children under the age of 13. The Federal Trade
                            Commission, the national consumer protection facility applies and carries out the COPPA
                            regulation, which provides for what website owners and online services have to do in order
                            to protect children’s privacy and security on the internet.</p>
                        <p>We do not exclusively market to children under the age of 13.</p>

                        <h2>Fair information practices</h2>
                        <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles are the foundation of the data protection act in
                            the United States and the principles contained therein play an important role in the
                            worldwide development of data protection laws. An understanding of the Fair Information
                            Practice principles and how they should be applied in practice is important for the
                            adherence of different data protection laws and the protection of personal data.</p>
                        <h5>To follow Fair Information Practices and in case a violation of data protection laws occurs
                            we will do the following:</h5>
                        <p>We will inform the user via email:</p>
                        <ul class="list">

                                Besides, we agree with the principles of individual remedy, where persons have a right
                                to exercise and enforce their rights in accordance to the law against data collectors
                                and processors who do not abide to the law. This principle does not only require an
                                individual to have enforceable rights against the data user but also that this person
                                has access to the courts and state authorities so as to investigate and/or to criminally
                                prosecute the data processor for not respecting the law.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Can SPAM Act</h2>
                        <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that regulates commercial emails, imposes requirements on
                            advertising messages, gives receivers the right to put a stop to receiving emails and
                            formulates strict sanctions in case of violations.</p>
